	<ul style="list-style: disc outside none; margin-left: 100; padding-left: 3em;line-height: 1.8;">
		<li>We haven't built out the security as we would like yet so please don't deploy any production data - we can't guarantee its security.</li>
		<li>This is not yet a production build so please don't use anything deployed on the trial as part of a production installation - we cannot guarantee system availability</li>
		<li>We will make every effort to ensure that the environment is continuously available but we cannot guarantee this</li>
		<li>We will make every effort to ensure that we don't remove / kill any applications that have been deployed to the environment but we cannot guarantee that an upgrade or rebuild will not require us to do this</li>
		<li>We will endeavour to keep all participants up to date with the latest information about the status of the trial</li>
		<li>If you require support please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@governmentpaas.zendesk.com">support@governmentpaas.zendesk.com</a>. We will aim to resolve all tickets within 4 business hours - let us know how we do.</li>
