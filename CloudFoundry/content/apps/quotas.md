## Quotas:

Cloud Foundry capacity is managed by quota. Quotas provide a not to exceed reservation of memory, compute, application routes and service instances. 

### Quota allocations:

We have allocated trial participants a default quota of:

- 1000 application routes.
- 10GB of RAM.
- 100 service instances.

#### Routes:

Hostname and domain pairs where an application that exposes a listening port can be reached.

#### RAM:

The amount of RAM available to your applications.

#### Service Instances:

The number of service instances available to your organization. 

#### Quota Limits:

If a new application `push` would exceed your organization's quota the request will fail with status code `400` and a message describing the limit that would be exceeded.

**Example:**

	Creating app APPLICATION in org ORG / space SPACE as USER...
	FAILED
	Server error, status code: 400, error code: 100007, message: You have exceeded the memory limit for your organization's quota.

In this situation you have three options:

1. Delete existing resources with `cf delete`, `delete-service`, `delete-route` or similar.
2. Reconfigure existing [Application Quotas](#application-quotas) and redeploy.
3. Request a quota change <gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>.

### Application Quotas:

As a Cloud Foundry user youâ€™re free to divide your organization's quota capacity amongst your applications as you see fit by way of application quotas. Application limits are specified in your application manifest or as `cf push` command line options.

#### Application Quota Options:

`memory: / -m`

The application memory limit. This setting has a dual-purpose as your application compute limit is derived from its memory limit. This relationship is explained in detail below.

`disk_quota / -k`

The maximum amount of disk space available to your app.

`instances: / -i`

Sets the number of application instances to launch. Each additional instance receives the same memory and disk reservation. An application with a manifest specifying `memory: 256M` and `instances: 4` would reserve 1GB (256M x 4) total.

#### Application Quota Options : Memory Share equals Compute Share

As noted above, your application's compute limit is derived from a its memory limit. Each application receives a compute share equal to its relative share of memory.

Your application will be guaranteed to receive a portion of the vCPU compute power equal to it's portion of memory allocation. 

Your application will be offered 100% of the vCPU compute power.

**Guaranteed:**

Your application will receive at least this much vCPU time even if there are other applications competing for time.

**Offered:** 

Your application can use all available CPU time. If there are other applications competing for time, each application's guaranteed share determines how much time it will receive.

**Limited:**

The application cannot access more than the specified amount of memory.


#### Application Quota Options : Sizing

- The environment default of 512MB `memory:` is sufficient for most applications. Static sites and utility applications such as schedulers or loaders may require less. Use `cf app APPNAME` to check your application's current memory and compute utilization.

- Any application which exceeds its memory quota will be automatically restarted. Use `cf events APPNAME` to look for 'out of memory' crashes.
