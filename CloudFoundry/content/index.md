# Govt PaaS Cloud Foundry Documentation

Welcome! Cloud Foundry is an open source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) system for managing the deployment of apps, services, and background tasks. GDS is planning to use it for many of our development and production systems as well as opening it up to any other agencies and departments who want to take advantage of it.

*Note:* We are currently trialling this with a non-production build in order to get as much feedback as possible and ensure we build the right thing for you. Because of this we recommend that:

- you don't deploy any production apps or services
- you don't put any production data onto the platform
- you don't rely on the platform being available 100%

We are working to make the platform production ready.
