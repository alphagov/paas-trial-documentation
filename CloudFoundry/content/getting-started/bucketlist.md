## We'd love you to try doing some of these: 

While you're experimenting with the platform we'd love for you to try to perform some (or all) of these tasks (and then give us feedback on how it went):


1. Deploy an application
1. Bind an application to a backing service (Postgres / Redis)
1. Scale the number of instances of your app (up and down)
1. Connect to your application from the outside world to ensure it works
1. Drive traffic to your application (if you have the tools to do this)
1. Perform a zero-downtime deploy of a new version of your app (for bonus points try this with traffic being driven to the app at the same time)
1. Remove your app
